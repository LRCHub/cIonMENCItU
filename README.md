[00:12.44] She, she ain't real
[00:15.71] She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
[00:20.44] She is a stranger
[00:24.46] You and I have history
[00:26.23] Or don't you remember
[00:28.31] Sure, she's got it all
[00:32.14] But, baby, is that really what you want
[00:38.42] Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
[00:41.78] She made a fool out of you
[00:43.73] And, boy, she's bringing you down
[00:45.70] She made your heart melt
[00:47.91] But you're cold to the core
[00:50.10] Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore
[00:53.49] Rumor has it (rumor)
[00:55.43] Rumor has it (rumor)
[00:57.41] Rumor has it (rumor)
[00:59.41] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:01.39] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:03.45] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:05.46] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:07.43] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:14.35] She is half your age
[01:17.94] But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
[01:21.63] I heard you've been missing me
[01:25.92] You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
[01:29.90] Like when we creep out and she ain't around
[01:34.22] Haven't you heard the rumors
[01:38.41] Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
[01:41.83] You made a fool out of me
[01:43.86] And, boy, you're bringing me down
[01:45.70] You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
[01:50.19] But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for
[01:53.48] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:55.47] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:57.45] Rumor has it (rumor)
[01:59.41] Rumor has it (rumor)
[02:01.38] Rumor has it (rumor)
[02:03.44] Rumor has it (rumor)
[02:05.46] Rumor has it (rumor)
[02:07.44] Rumor has it (rumor)
[02:20.44] All of these words whispered in my ear
[02:28.15] Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
[02:35.22] Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
[02:42.81] People say crazy things
[02:48.61] Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
[02:55.01] Just 'cause you heard it
[03:02.48] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:04.47] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:06.49] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:08.48] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:10.46] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:12.48] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:14.49] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:16.51] Rumor has it (rumor-rumor)
[03:20.52] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:22.48] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:24.48] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:26.50] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:28.55] Rumor has it (rumor)
[03:30.52] Rumor has it
[03:31.32] But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for
